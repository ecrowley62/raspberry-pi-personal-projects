# raspberry-pi-personal-projects
## Overview
This repository contains my personal creations for use with the Raspberry Pi 3. Decided pull this out,
along with the bread board and all that good POC electronics goodness, and brush the dust of these skills.
Additionally plan to create a thermostat program for use with any plug in heater
